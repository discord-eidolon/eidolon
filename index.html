Okay, I can absolutely help you with that! Having just an index.html is a great start. To make your website look a bit nicer and be more organized, we'll add a CSS file for styling and a simple README for your GitHub repository.

Here are the files you'll need, along with their content.

This is the central HTML file that browsers will load. It includes the structure for your documentation, FAQs, and bot invite.
